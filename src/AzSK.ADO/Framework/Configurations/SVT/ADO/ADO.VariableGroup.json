            "Rationale": "If a variable group containing secrets is marked as accessible to all pipelines then an attacker can extract or compromise the assets involving the secret variables by creating a new pipeline.",

            "MethodName": "CheckInheritedPermissions",
            "Rationale": "Disabling inherited permissions lets you finely control access to various operations at the variable group level for different stakeholders. This ensures that you follow the principle of least privilege and provide access only to the persons that require it.",
            "Recommendation": "To disable inheritance follow the steps given here: 1.Navigate to the variable group. 2. Select Security. 3. Turn off Inheritance. As best practice, all teams/groups must be granted minimum required permissions on variable group.",
