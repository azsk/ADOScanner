      "Rationale": "Each additional person in the build administrator role increases the attack surface for the entire project (if an admin's credentials are compromised via a phishing attack). A compromised account of this group can create/tamper resources such as builds and task groups. The number of members in these roles should be kept as low as possible.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Project settings --> 2. General --> 3. Permissions --> 4. Groups --> 5. Select the group : Build Administrators --> 6. Remove the redundant members of this group",
