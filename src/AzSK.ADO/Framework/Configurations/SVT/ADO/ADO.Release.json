      "MethodName": "CheckCredInReleaseVariables",
      "Rationale": "Keeping secrets such as connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in plain text can expose the credentials to a wider audience and can lead to credential theft. Marking them as secret protects them from unitended disclosure and/or misuse.",

      "MethodName": "CheckForInactiveReleases",
      "Rationale": "Each additional release having access to repositories/other artifacts increases the attack surface. To minimize this risk ensure that only active and legitimate release pipelines are present in your environment.",

      "MethodName": "CheckInheritedPermissions",
      "Rationale": "Disabling inherited permissions lets you finely control access to various operations at the release level for different stakeholders. This ensures that you follow the principle of least privilege and provide access only to the persons that require it.",
      "Recommendation": "To disable permission inheritance within a release pipeline follow these steps: 1.Navigate to the release pipeline. 2. Open up the Security dialog for the release. 3. Add the service lead & service owner as Users with Allow permissions for each permission line item. 4. Select Off under Inheritance. 5. Add users/groups to your release definition and provide only required access. As best practice, All teams/groups must be granted minimum required permissions on release definition.",

      "Rationale": "Periodic review of approvers list for production releases ensures that only appropriate people are members of such a critical role. As team composition/membership changes, this privilege may need to be revoked from members who are no more in the team.",

      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "You should ensure that production releases are always done from one and only one (main) branch. The main branch should have the tightest access controls and approval standards. Any changes in the source code should be tested first on a development branch before merging in the main branch. The source code in the main branch should correspond to production bits at all times. This helps in maintaining stable source code and helps prevent deployment of breaking changes (and potential security bugs) into the production environment.",
      "Recommendation": "You can choose a specific branch as the main branch for production releases (most teams use 'master'). When adding the source/artifact for a release configuration for a production release (as in steps at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/artifacts?view=azure-devops#sources, make sure you use the designated branch as the source.",
