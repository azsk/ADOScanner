      "MethodName": "CheckInactiveRepo",
      "Rationale": "Each additional repository being accessed by pipelines increases the attack surface. To minimize this risk ensure that only active and legitimate repositories are present in project.",

      "Rationale": "If a broad group of users (e.g., Contributors) have permissions to upload package to feed, then integrity of your pipeline can be compromised by a malicious user who uploads a package.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to Project --> 2. Artifacts --> 3. Select Feed --> 4. Feed Settings --> 5. Permissions --> 6. Groups --> 7.
