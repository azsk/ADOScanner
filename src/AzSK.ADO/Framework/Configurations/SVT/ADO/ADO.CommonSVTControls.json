      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckInactiveRepo",
      "Rationale": "Each additional repository being accessed by pipelines increases the attack surface. To minimize this risk ensure that only active and legitimate repositories are present in project.",

      "Rationale": "If a broad group of users (e.g., Contributors) have permissions to upload package to feed, then integrity of your pipeline can be compromised by a malicious user who uploads a package.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to Project --> 2. Artifacts --> 3. Select Feed --> 4. Feed Settings --> 5. Permissions --> 6. Groups --> 7. Review users/groups which have administrator and contributor roles. Ensure broader groups have read-only access. Refer to detailed scan log (Feed.LOG) for broader group list.",

Under 'Pipeline Permissions', remove pipelines that secure file no more requires access to or click 'Restrict Permission' to avoid granting access to all pipelines.",
