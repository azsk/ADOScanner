      "Rationale": "SPN-based logins do not have MFA protection. It is important to restrict the access granted to Azure service connections only to specific resource/resource group as needed. This can contain the extent of damage in case of compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Make sure you add SPN at the specific permission scope and role required for your scenario. For example, sometimes 'Contributor' access at 'Resource Group' scope might work.
